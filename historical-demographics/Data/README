This is from the American Community Survey, and I think we should try to use this source as much as possible.  It has data on the Neighborhood Tabulation Area-/PUMA-level and city-level, so we can get pretty fine-grained with what we want to consider Harlem, and it's pretty reputable as a data source.  We might also be able to find the same survey for NYS and USA.  
Each file is a different data subject (Economic, Demographic, Housing, Social), and the year.
